          <h4>Hi there! First off, I am a graduate from the University of California, Davis with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering. While at UC Davis, I worked as a Student Assistant at the college&#39;s Engineering Fabrication Lab, where I completed various manufacturing projects, supervised and assisted student shop users, and operated the College of Engineering&#39;s 3D rapid prototyping printer. Working with this revolutionary new technology allowed me to explore my passion for fusing engineering with creative design.<br><br>After graduating, I expanded my knowledge of 3D technologies working part-time for a direct-to-consumer body scanning company while also launching a custom 3D printing company of my own. Since then, I have also worked as a Mechanical Engineering temp designing subsea instrumentation and fixtures for oil extraction and transportation. My most current employment at a manufacturing corporation required the application of engineering principles to design and coordinate unique architectural projects for commercial businesses as well as clients in the private sector.<br><br>I am currently taking some time off work to study full-stack web developement and further my computer programming expertise.</h4>
